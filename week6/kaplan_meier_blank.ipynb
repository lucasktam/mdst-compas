Men in the high-risk group may show a faster decline in survival probability, suggesting they are more prone to reoffend. For women, even in the high-risk group, the survival probability may decrease at a slower rate than men.\n",

For instance, African-American individuals may exhibit a higher rate of recidivism in similar risk categories compared to Caucasian individuals, potentially highlighting racial disparities. This could be due to a range of socio-economic factors and historical biases that may influence both the likelihood of reoffending and the assessment itself."
